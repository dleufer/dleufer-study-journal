This folder will hold your quizzes.  You'll have one quiz markdown for each topic in your study journal GitBook.  Each day when you review your notes and link them to the concepts you learned, add a question or two in the corresponding quiz. You can use this as a self-study refresher, or to challenge your study buddies.
